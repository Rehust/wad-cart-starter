# AI-LOG.md — template (CSC13008)

Copy this file into the root of your team repository and keep it up to date.
Every submission in this course includes it.

## How to use it

- One entry per task where an assistant did part of the work.
- Three honest lines are enough. This is an account, not a transcript.
- Write it as you go. Reconstructing it the night before never reads true.
- Declaring heavy use costs you nothing. A team that declares 80% and can
explain all of it scores higher than a team that declares nothing and freezes
at the oral.

## The five rules, in short

1. AI is allowed and encouraged in every assignment. Only the final exam is
written without it.
2. Declare it here.
3. You own the code. "The AI wrote it" is not a defence.
4. You will be asked. Anything you cannot explain scores zero, even if it runs.
5. No secrets in prompts: no API keys, no real user data, no classmate's work.

## Entry format

```md
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — <what you were working on>
Tool: <Claude Code / Copilot / Cursor / something else / none>
Asked for: <the task you gave it, in one sentence>
Kept: <what you took as it came>
Changed: <what you rewrote, and why>
Rejected: <what you threw away, and why>
By hand: <the parts you wrote yourself>
```

`Rejected` and `By hand` are the two lines we read most closely. "I wrote this
part myself" is a perfectly good entry.

## A filled example

```md
## 2026-09-24 — product list page
Tool: Claude Code.
Asked for: ProductList + ProductCard from the spec in docs/spec-catalogue.md.
Kept: the component split, the prop names.
Changed: it invented a useFetch hook — replaced with our fetchJson helper.
It stored the filtered array in state; I derived it during render.
Rejected: its CSS. We use the team's design tokens.
By hand: the empty-state and error-state markup.

## 2026-09-25 — GET /api/products?q=
Tool: none. Written by hand to understand the query builder first.
```

## What a weak log looks like

```md
## Week 3
Used AI for the frontend. Fixed some things.
```

It says nothing we can check, and nothing that helps you at the oral. If a task
took you three hours of argument with a tool, that story is worth one line — it
is evidence you were in control.
